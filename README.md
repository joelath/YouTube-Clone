This is a guided project I completed following a free HTML & CSS course on YouTube at the end of 2024 through to the beginning of 2025.
During the course, I completed 91 exercises developing my skills across different techniques including:
- Nested elements
- Grid
- Flexbox
- CSS alignment and position
My intention for uploading this is not to claim it as my own creation, but rather to showcase my learning journey as a developer and commitment to continuous learning.
